## 🔄 Replace Colors with Your Photos

By default, the project uses color sample images (`download (1).jpg`, `download (2).jpg`, etc.). To use your own photos:

### ✅ Steps

1. Replace the image files in the project folder with your own images.
2. Make sure the file names match or update the HTML like this:

```html
<!-- Old -->
<img src="download (1).jpg" alt=" " />

<!-- New -->
<img src="your-photo1.jpg" alt="Nature 1" />

<a href="https://www.instagram.com/yourusername" class="lin" target="_blank">
  <h2>@yourusername</h2>
</a>
